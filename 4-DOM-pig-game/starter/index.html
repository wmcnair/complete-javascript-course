        GAME RULES:

            - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds

            - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. 
              Each result gets added to his ROUND score

            - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. 
              After that, it's the next player's turn

            - Also, a player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. 
              After that, it's the next player's turn.

            - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means his ROUND score is added to his GL0BAL score 
              After that, it's the next player's turn

            - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
